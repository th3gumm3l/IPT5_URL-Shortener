## ðŸ¥‡Self-reflection
1. The biggest problem at the beginning was getting used to asp.Net. At first, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to approach the topic. <br>
I overcame the issue by asking my colleague Yazdan Musa. He was able to help me with everything from start to finish as he is a professional.

2. The topic asp.Net didn't leave me alone. I would have been happy if we had had this as a module at school with the teacher because I think the backend is very important. The problem was constantly imagining how that works and how that communicates with the frontend. As a solution to this problem, I looked at tutorials and explanations. I will keep myself informed about it in the future.

3. Another problem was getting used to HTML and CSS again. To my surprise, this was reintroduced relatively quickly. In the end, I had fewer trouble finding my way around. 

4. The following problem was astounding for me personally: I haven't had any major problems dividing my time up to now, but it was a challenge for me with this project. I can only explain it to myself because it's the end of the semester and the energy is gone. I couldn't explain this problem any other way. I solved it by pulling myself together again and again and working on the project for a few hours.

5. Furthermore, I initially had problems with my folder structure. I didn't know how to structure my folders and how to pack them with the other subfolders. I solved that by looking at the structures of others and comparing them with previous projects.
